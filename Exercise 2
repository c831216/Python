# Exercise 2 (and Solution)
# Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, 
# print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number 
# react differently when divided by 2?

# Extras:

# If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
# Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and 
# one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, 
# tell that to the user. 
# If not, print a different appropriate message.

num = int(input("Please enter any number that comes to mind: "))
check = int(input("Please enter a second number: "))
msg1 = "your 2nd number divides evenly into your 1st one."
msg2 = "your 2nd number doesn't divide evenly into your 1st one."

if (num % check) == 0:
  msg = msg1
else: 
  msg = msg2
  
if (num % 2) == 0:
  if (num % 4) != 0:
    print("You entered an EVEN number and ", msg)
  elif (num % 4) == 0:
    print("You seem to have entered an EVEN number that's a multiple of 4 and ", msg)
else:
    print("You definitely entered an ODD number and ", msg)
