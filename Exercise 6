# Exercise 6 (and Solution)
# Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. 
# (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

nstr = str(input("Please enter a word so that we can check if it's a palindrome: "))
# print (nstr)
n = len(nstr)
b = n - 1
# print(b)
i = 0
while i < n:
    # print(nstr[i])
    # print(nstr[b])
    if (nstr[i] == nstr[b]):
        i += 1
        b -= 1
    else:
        print("Definitely not a palindrome.")
        exit()
print("Looks like you entered a palindrome.")
