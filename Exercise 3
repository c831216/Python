# Exercise 3 (and Solution)

# Take a list, say for example this one:

# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

# Extras:

# Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements 
# less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python.
# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 2, 1, 0]
nlist = []
i = 0
len = len(list)

while i < len:
  if(list[i] < 5):
    nlist.append(list[i])
  i += 1

for item in nlist:
    print(item, end=" ")
