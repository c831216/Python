# Exercise 4 (and Solution)

# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all 
# the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number 
# that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 
# because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

num = int(input("Please enter any number and I'll list it's divisors: "))
dlist = []
i = 1

while i < num:
    if (num % i) == 0:
        dlist.append(i)
    i += 1

print ("This is your list of divisors: ",dlist,)
